## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r cars}

#Load libraries and packages used for the EDA
summary(cars)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
library(gtsummary)
library(ggplot2)
library(naniar)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

#Upload new Dataframe and create a CSV for repository 
#new_df

new_df<- read.csv("C:/Users/VGSCHOOL/project1.csv")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


#Ask about the 0 in num cigs and see if they are supposed to all of the NAs be 0  

```{r}
new_df[,c(22:28)]<-lapply(new_df[,c (22:28)],function(x) ifelse(x=="",NA,x))
#new_df[c,22:28] <- lapply(new_df[,22:28], function(x) ifelse(x == "1=Yes", 1, x))
#new_df[c,22:28] <- lapply(new_df[,22:28], function(x) ifelse(x == "2=No", 0, x))

#Factor character variables in dataset

  mutate_if(is.character,factor)

AIM 2: Explore links between self-regulation at baseline and substance and externalizing at 6- and 12-month follow-ups.


AIM3: Identify self-regulation problems that mediate the link between SDP/ETS exposure and level of, and change in, SU and EXT severity over time.
