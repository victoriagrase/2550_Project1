# 2550_Project1
Project 1 Repository 

The repository file contains two main files in which are the R code and the readme. The data was pre-processed and given to us by our instructor Dr. Alice Paul who merged the study data for both child and parent to combine the data together to fit under one parent ID.The new dataset contained included variables such as race, education, income, parental smoking status during pregnancy, post-partum, and exposure to tobacco smoke of a 5 year follow-up after the birth of child, substance use, and contimean levels, self-regulation variables, and externalizing variables. We were supposed to focus mainly on aim 1 to  examine effects of SDP/ETS on adolescent self-regulation, substance use, and externalizing. The Project 1 PHP 2550 Final.rmd file in this repository is the exploratory data analysis. This file used the dplyr, kableExtra, gtsummary, naniar, ggplot2, gridExtra, and tidyverse packages. In the EDA I reformatted the data, looking at the missingness, baseline characteristics, summary statistics, regression analysis, and descriptive statistics focusing on the outcomes mentioned above.
